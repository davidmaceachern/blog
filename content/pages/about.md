Hi 👋🏻! my name is David MacEachern, this blog is a place for me to share some perspective on subjects I have explored in the past.

Outside of working on software; I like to spend time in the mountains ⛰️, camping ⛺, and climbing 🧗. 

I am a certified AWS Solution Architect associate and software developer with 4 years of experience at each stage in the lifecycle of enterprise software on remote teams.

I am looking for work, so if you need someone for some systems software development and you can hire EMEA/Remote then please [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-maceachern-35943440/)

Any opinions expressed here are my original ideas, and not that of my employers past or present. Je kiffe les fromage.

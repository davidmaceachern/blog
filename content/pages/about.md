My name is David MacEachern, this blog is a place for me to share some perspective on what I am learning about, whilst it's mainly for my benefit maybe it might help you too.

Outside of working I like to spend time in the mountains ‚õ∞Ô∏è, camping ‚õ∫ and climbing üßó.

I am a certified AWS Solution Architect associate and software developer with almost 4 years experience at each stage of the lifecycle of enteprise software.

My first years in the industry I gained experience with linux virtual machines and waterfall processes, and the second half of my time with microservice architectures on AWS coupled with agile practices.

Any opinions expressed here are my own original ideas, and not that of my employer.

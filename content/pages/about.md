My name is David MacEachern, this blog is a place for me to share some perspective on what I am learning about, whilst it's mainly for my benefit maybe it might help you too.

Outside of working on software; I like to spend time in the mountains ‚õ∞Ô∏è, camping ‚õ∫, and climbing üßó.

I am a certified AWS Solution Architect associate and software developer with almost 4 years of experience at each stage in the lifecycle of enterprise software.

During my first years in the Technology Industry, I gained experience with Linux virtual machines and waterfall processes, and the second half of my time with microservice architectures on AWS coupled with agile development practices.

Any opinions expressed here are my original ideas, and not that of my employer.
